# Google-Apps-Script
Programs and Functions developed in Google Apps Script

Google Apps Script is an extension of Javascript designed to integrate with Google's suite of office applications, such as Sheets, Drive and Docs.

During the Summer of 2021, I held an internship position at the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection. My job was to convert Excel spreadsheets and the Visual Basic code within them to Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. Most of the code found here will be from this internship, posted on GitHub with permission from my supervisor at the time. All code found here is new, unique code either written or found and edited by me for use with Google Sheets, and not code directly translated from VBA. Due to the myriad of functional differences between VBA and GAS, several spreadsheets required me to create entirely new code within them to preserve functionality that the spreadsheets had in Excel.

Any code that is not mine will contain a link to the original source, even if that original source code was edited (which is why it is within this repository). I do not claim to own any code used from other sources, only any edits made to it by myself.
